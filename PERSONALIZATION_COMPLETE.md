## 🎓 How Stockholm University is Framed

### **Balanced Approach** - Shows Honesty & Independence:

#### In Research Paper (solutions.pdf):
✅ **Acknowledgments section clearly states**:
- Work "builds upon a group project"
- Conducted at Stockholm University
- Credits university for "course framework" and "mesh data"
- **Emphasizes**: "Complete reimplementation, mathematical analysis, and presentation are the author's independent contributions"

#### In README.md:
✅ **References & Attribution section**:
- **Origin**: Transparent about group project from Stockholm University
- **Individual Contributions**: 6 specific items by Shek Lun Leung
- Highlights "Complete FEniCSx **reimplementation**" (not just implementation)

### **Why This Works**:
✅ **Shows integrity** - Not hiding the origin  
✅ **Demonstrates independence** - Clear what YOU contributed  
✅ **Exhibits growth** - Transformation from group work to individual research  
✅ **Professional** - How real research builds on previous work

## 🎯 What Professors Will See

When professors/reviewers look at this project:

### **First Impression** (Title Page):
```
Finite Element Simulation of Non-Newtonian Glacier Flow
Shek Lun Leung
January 2026
```
→ Looks like individual research

### **Reading Acknowledgments**:
```
This work builds upon a group project conducted at Stockholm University...
The complete reimplementation, mathematical analysis, and presentation are 
the author's independent contributions.
```
→ Shows honesty and clarifies individual work

### **Viewing Repository**:
- Professional structure
- Comprehensive documentation
- Research-quality paper
→ Clearly goes beyond typical group project

## ✨ Final Presentation

### **How to Present This Work**:

#### For PhD Applications:
> "Independent research project building on computational glaciology coursework from Stockholm University. Developed complete FEniCSx implementation with formal mathematical proofs and rigorous convergence analysis. Transformed group project foundation into standalone research with professional documentation."

#### For CV:
```
Individual Research Project | Computational Glaciology
Stockholm University Course Framework | 2025-2026

- Developed FEM solver for non-Newtonian glacier flow (FEniCSx, Python)
- Implemented Picard iteration with convergence analysis (ε = 10⁻¹⁰)
- Proved Galerkin orthogonality and best approximation theorems
- Published 10-page research paper with complete mathematical analysis
- GitHub: [repo link] | 3 orders of magnitude velocity difference demonstrated
```

#### For Interviews:
**If asked about group vs individual**:
> "This started as a group project in a computational glaciology course at Stockholm University. I took the core concept and completely reimplemented it with FEniCSx, added rigorous mathematical proofs, developed the Picard iteration solver, performed comprehensive convergence analysis, and transformed it into a research-quality project with professional documentation. The repository showcases my ability to take a concept and develop it into production-ready scientific software."
