# Individual Research Project: Advanced Glacier Dynamics Analysis

## Overview

This folder contains an independent research paper and supporting materials exploring advanced numerical methods for non-Newtonian glacier flow. This work builds upon the foundational implementations in the parent repository but represents original research and analysis.

## Purpose

This research project is designed to:
- Demonstrate advanced technical writing and research capabilities
- Showcase deep understanding of computational glaciology
- Present novel insights into FEM implementation for complex geophysical flows
- Serve as a portfolio piece for academic and industry applications

## Structure

```

├── paper.tex           # Main research paper (LaTeX)
├── bibliography.bib    # References
├── README.md          # This file
├── figures/           # Figures and plots for the paper
├── code/              # Supporting code and experiments
└── data/              # Additional data files
```

## Compilation

To compile the paper:
```bash
cd research
pdflatex paper.tex
bibtex paper
pdflatex paper.tex
pdflatex paper.tex
```

Or use your preferred LaTeX build system.

## Future Plans

Once completed, this research project will be moved to its own dedicated repository to showcase individual research capabilities separate from group project work.

## Notes

- This is independent research building on concepts from the main glacier-dynamics-fem project
- All original work and analysis
- Intended for academic portfolio and publication
