## 💡 How to Present This Work

### **On CV**:
```
Finite Element Glacier Flow Simulation | Individual Research
Stockholm University Framework | 2025-2026

• Developed FEM solver for non-Newtonian glacier dynamics (FEniCSx, Python, MPI)
• Implemented Picard iteration achieving convergence in 3-10 iterations
• Proved Galerkin orthogonality and best approximation theorems (Céa's Lemma)
• Published 10-page research paper with comprehensive mathematical analysis
• Demonstrated 3 orders of magnitude velocity difference (linear vs non-linear)
• GitHub: github.com/alanspace/picard-fem-glacier-flow
```

### **In Cover Letter**:
> "I led the complete reimplementation and extension of a computational glaciology project, transforming a group coursework foundation from Stockholm University into an independent research project. I developed a production-ready FEniCSx solver, proved key mathematical theorems, and documented the work in a 10-page research paper. This project demonstrates my ability to take a concept and develop it into professional-quality scientific software with rigorous mathematical foundations."

### **When Asked in Interviews**:
> "This project showcases my ability to take foundational work and elevate it significantly. Starting from a group project framework at Stockholm University, I completely reimplemented the solver using modern FEniCSx, added formal mathematical proofs including Galerkin orthogonality and convergence theorems, developed a robust Picard iteration method, and transformed it into a research-quality project with comprehensive documentation. The repository demonstrates both my technical depth in numerical methods and my software engineering capabilities."
