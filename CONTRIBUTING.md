# Contributing to Picard FEM Glacier Flow

Thank you for your interest in this computational glaciology project!

## Project Context

This repository represents **individual academic work** developed from a group project. It has been significantly extended and reorganized to showcase:

- Complete implementation of FEM solvers
- Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs
- Professional software engineering practices
- Comprehensive documentation

## Code Style

This project follows standard Python conventions:

- **PEP 8** style guide for Python code
- Type hints where appropriate
- Docstrings for all functions and classes
- Clear variable naming (physics notation where applicable)

## Documentation Standards

All mathematical notation should:
- Use Unicode symbols in comments where readable
- Include LaTeX equations in docstrings for complex formulas
- Reference equations by number from `solutions.pdf`

## Questions & Discussion

For questions about the methodology or implementation:
1. Check `solutions.pdf` for theoretical background
2. Review code comments for implementation details
3. Open an issue for technical discussions

## Attribution

This is an **individual academic portfolio piece**. Group project origins are acknowledged in README.md.
